# Crime Date EDA
In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on criminal data from the USA. This included examining the relationship between the type of crime and its geographical location, performing trend analysis spanning from 2016 to 2020, and utilizing geographic data to create maps highlighting areas with high crime rates.

## Description
I investigated the following issues:
- Extent of the Situation.
- Variability Over Time.
- Most Dangerous Month.
- Cities to Avoid.
- Crime Rate.
- Is It Safer During the Day?
- Relation Between Locations and Types of Crimes.
- Most Common Crime.
- Situation in New York.

The project was implemented in the R programming language and the documentation is written in Polish.

## Purpose
The project was completed as part of the coursework for the Introduction to Data Analysis course.
